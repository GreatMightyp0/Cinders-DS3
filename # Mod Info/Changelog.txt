# Changelog
#------------------------------

 - Drops Soul of the Maiden, which can be transposed into:
  - Blueblood Sword
  - Quicksilver Shield
  - Life Ring
 - The Quicksilver Set will appear in the swamp cave after they have been defeated.
 
# Map
- Changed the Church of Sin bonfire into the Swamp of Sin and moved it onto the wooden platform above the swamp in the Profaned Capital.
- Removed enemies near the Secluded Cloister bonfire.
- Removed the skeletons in the Shared Grave.
- Ringed City Streets and Shared Grave bonfires are no longer locked behind intruder kills.
- Moved Freya and the Moaning Knight intruders into rooms within the Shared Grave.
- Added Scribe's Retreat bonfire on the Cathedral of the Deep.
 
# Items
- Changed Bone Fragment item to Petrified Something.
- Changed the sources of Petrified Somethings.
- Added consumable: Titanite Fragment - Boosts poise by 50% for 60 seconds.
- Added consumable: Inferi Petal - Boosts damage against Undead by 20% for 60 seconds.
- Added consumable: Combustum Petal - Boosts damage against Demons by 20% for 60 seconds.
- Added consumable: Vindicti Petal - Boosts damage against Hollows by 20% for 60 seconds.
- Added consumable: Barathrum Petal - Boosts damage against Abyssals by 20% for 60 seconds.

- You can now sell Estus Shards/Undead Bone Shards for 10000 souls.

# Weapon
- Reduced Frostfall INT requirement to 40.
- Reduced the damage of the Dagger/Paired Dagger category.
- Weapons with no innate physical damage no longer have the Lethal, Sharp, Blunt infusions.
- Weapons with INT/FTH requirements now adjust their requirements with the following infusions: Magic, Fire, Lightning, Dark, Enchanted, Holy.
- Adjusted the requirements for several weapons with INT/FTH requirements so they aren't so low (and therefore pointless as requirements).
- Added INT/FTH requirements to some weapons that dealt elemental damage but had no INT/FTH requirements before.
- Corvian Longstaff WA now changes which aux it inflicts if infused with Curse/Bleed/Frost.
- Added p0's torch VFX changes.

# Catalysts
- Catalyst infusions now require 1 Smouldering Stone, which is dropped like a gem from select mobs, and unlocked for bonfire forging upon reaching the Grand Archives.

# Magic
- Scattering Soul Orb now has an unique icon.
- Scattering Crystal Orb now has an unique icon.
- Orbs of Judgment now has an unique icon.
- Blizzard now has an unique icon.

- Changed the Throbbing infusion to -10% spell FP cost.
- Increased the HP regen from the Vibrating infusion to 5.
- Added a new infusion: Laughing. This converts the catalyst into a LCK catalyst and halves the amount of INT/FTH needed to cast spells (the UI doesn't reflect this however).
