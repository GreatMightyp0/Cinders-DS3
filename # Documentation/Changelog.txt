# Merchants
- Solaire now sells Lifegem, Radiant Lifegem, Old Radiant Lifegem and Rouge Water.
 
# Map
- Moved some chests in High Wall.
- Removed/moved some enemies in High Wall to make it easier to traverse on initial runthrough.
- The lift down to the lower area of the High Wall is available immediate, but the lower courtyard requires you to beat a Lothric Knight before you can proceed.
- Added a portcullis in front of Corrupted Gundyr's fogwall. This is to discourage immediate engagement with him. It can be raised by a lever found in the upper area with the 2 chests. Once opened, it remains open.

# Bugfix
- Fixed the HP effectiveness adjustment being incorrect for affixed Unholy Remains and Wretched Pendant.
