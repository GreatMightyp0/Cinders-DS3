# Bugfix

# Classes
- Acolyte now starts with the Censuring Palm instead of the Staff of Serpents
- Assassin now starts with Magic Weapon instead of Spook

# Training Dummies
- There is now a NPC called the Bone Collector where El Hueso used to be found.
- This NPC allows you to enable 3 types of training dummies:
 - Immovable: doesn't get moved by normal attacks
 - Movable: is moved by normal attacks
 - Aggressive: attacks you to allow for parry training
- You can toggle between Inside and Outside training with the Bone Collector. This will switch the positions of the dummies and the NPC to their outside/inside locations.
