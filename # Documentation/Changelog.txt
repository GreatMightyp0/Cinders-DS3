# Harmonixer
Finish adding the new stats and effects for Pyromancies, Miracles and Hexes
Change healing spells to heal when holding the cast

# Vawser
Adjust the broken questlines so they use a custom method of progression
 - Potential change:
  - Break each quest into its individual stages, these stages are tied to usage of the relevant NPC as a summon on a previous boss
  - Once the NPC has been used once, the stage will appear.
  - Progression is done via the NPC usage (except in circumstances where that doesn't make sense)
  
  - Greirat:
   - Tie loot in shop to NPC usage of Greirat in Undead Settlement, Irithyll, then Lothric Castle. If used in Lothric Castle he dies in Firelink.
   
  - Yoel:
   - Usable for Crystal Sage, dies after usage there.
   
  - Yuria
   - Appears after Yoel dies.
   - Usable for Soul of Cinder, if used and Anri was used for Pontiff Sulyvahn, Lord of Hollows ending occurs.
   
  - Anri
   - Usable for Deacons of the Deep, triggers Firelink appearance.
   - Usable for Pontiff Sulyvahn, triggers Darkmoon Tomb stuff
   - If Pilgrim is killed, usable for Aldrich
   
  - Horace
   - Usable for Abyss Watchers, triggers Anri/Horace stuff in Catacombs/Lake
