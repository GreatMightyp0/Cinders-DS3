# TODO
#------------------------------
# Harmonixer
Finish adding the new stats and effects for Pyromancies, Miracles and Hexes
Change healing spells to heal when holding the cast

Adjust the broken questlines so they use a custom method of progression

  - Once the NPC has been used once, the stage will appear.
  - Progression is done via the NPC usage (except in circumstances where that doesn't make sense)
  
  - Greirat:
   - Tie loot in shop to NPC usage of Greirat in Undead Settlement, Irithyll, then Lothric Castle. If used in Lothric Castle he dies in Firelink.
   
  - Yoel:
   - Usable for Crystal Sage, dies after usage there.
   
  - Yuria
   - Appears after Yoel dies.
