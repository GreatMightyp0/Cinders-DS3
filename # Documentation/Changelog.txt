# TODO

Add Solaire as summon to Soul of Cinder

Yhorm the Giant: remove the silly rockstorm, perhaps add some firey bullets to adds. Add minor mechanic that summons in Siegward irrespective of the quest.
The Marauder: add more red fire flair to attacks, perhaps add healing bonfire mechanic, where you need to destroy the bonfire to stop it healing the Marauder
